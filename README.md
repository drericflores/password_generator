# password_generator

This application is neither novel nor groundbreaking; in fact, there are many similar tools available. However, it was specifically designed and coded with educational purposes in mind. The primary goal of this project is to provide a learning platform for understanding secure password generation and software development. This application was developed exclusively for Debian-based distributions, with a particular focus on Pop!_OS, to ensure compatibility and optimal performance within this environment.

Note for ever langage you wish to use., you need include the .ts file (Example: for English  - password_generator_en.ts_) I only uploaded the Spanish language .ts.
